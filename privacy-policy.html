  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p class="meta">
    <strong>Developer / Publisher:</strong> <span>Watanabe Heaven</span><br />
    <strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span>2025-12-23</span><br />
    <strong>Applies to:</strong> Mobile applications and services published by <span>Watanabe Heaven</span> on Google Play (the “Apps”).
  </p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Watanabe Heaven</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information
    when you use our mobile applications and related services (collectively, the “Apps”), including apps distributed via Google Play.
    If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Apps.
  </p>

  <div class="box note">
    <strong>Scope note (important):</strong>
    Each App may have its own in-app features. When an App provides additional notices or in-app disclosures (for example, for a specific feature),
    those notices supplement this Privacy Policy.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We strive to collect as little personal information as possible. Many of our Apps do not require you to create an account and do not ask
    for your name, address, phone number, or other direct identifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on the App and your device settings, we (and our third-party service providers) may collect the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device and technical information</strong> (e.g., device model, operating system version, language, time zone, app version).</li>
    <li><strong>Identifiers</strong> (e.g., Google Advertising ID and other identifiers used for ad delivery and measurement).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage information</strong> (e.g., app interactions, pages/screens viewed, session duration, feature usage).</li>
    <li><strong>Log and diagnostic data</strong> (e.g., IP address, crash reports, performance data, timestamps).</li>
    <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (e.g., inferred from IP address in some cases; we do not collect precise GPS location unless an App explicitly asks and you grant permission).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Information You Provide</h2>
  <p>
    Some Apps may allow you to provide information voluntarily (for example, sending feedback by email). If you contact us, we may receive
    the information you choose to share (such as your email address and the contents of your message).
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Apps.</li>
    <li>Personalize or improve user experience (where applicable).</li>
    <li>Show advertisements and measure ad performance.</li>
    <li>Monitor, debug, and improve performance and stability (including crash diagnostics).</li>
    <li>Protect against fraud, abuse, and security incidents.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms where applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Advertising (Google AdMob and Similar Services)</h2>
  <p>
    Some of our Apps display ads using third-party advertising services such as Google AdMob. These services may collect and process information
    (including identifiers like the Google Advertising ID) to deliver ads, measure ad performance, and prevent fraud.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on your settings and region, ads may be personalized or non-personalized. You can often control ad personalization through your
    device settings (e.g., Android “Ads” settings) and, where available, your Google account settings.

  <h2>5. Analytics, Crash Reporting, and Other Third-Party Providers</h2>
  <p>
    We may use third-party services to help us understand usage, improve performance, and fix bugs (for example, analytics and crash reporting tools).
    These providers may collect device and diagnostic information according to their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following situations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With service providers</strong> who process information on our behalf (e.g., advertising, analytics, crash reporting).</li>
    <li><strong>For legal reasons</strong> (e.g., to comply with applicable law, enforce policies, or respond to lawful requests).</li>
    <li><strong>To protect rights and safety</strong> (e.g., to prevent fraud, abuse, or security incidents).</li>
    <li><strong>With your consent</strong> when you choose to share information or explicitly authorize sharing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We generally do not store personal information on our own servers unless an App explicitly provides a server-based feature.
    Information processed by third-party providers is retained according to their retention policies.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure,
    and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our Apps are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect
    personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through our Apps, please contact us.
  </p>

  <h2>10. International Users</h2>
  <p>
    If you use our Apps from outside your country, your information may be processed in countries where we or our service providers operate.
    By using the Apps, you consent to such processing to the extent permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ad personalization:</strong> Manage via Android settings and Google account settings where available.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can control app permissions in your device settings. Some features may not work without certain permissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> You can stop further information collection by uninstalling the Apps.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the “Effective Date” above.
    Your continued use of the Apps after changes become effective means you accept the updated policy.
  </p>
